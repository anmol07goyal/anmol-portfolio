              I oversaw the programming for LearnFest, a web-based learning
              application, with an emphasis on presenting educational content
              using cutting-edge 2D and 3D simulations. Among my main
              contributions are:

                <b>Extensive Simulations:</b>
                80â€“100 interactive simulations covering a broad range of topics,
                including science, math, and more, were developed to create an
                immersive and captivating learning environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>&#8226;</span>
                <b>Cross-Subject Expertise: </b>
                Participated in simulations spanning a range of academic levels
                and subjects, guaranteeing a thorough and inclusive learning
                environment.

                <span>&#8226;</span>
                <b>WebGL Integration: </b>
                By utilising Unity, WebGL technology was smoothly integrated,
                allowing students to access simulations straight from their web
                browsers and promoting convenience and accessibility.
              </li>

            <p>
              LearnFest is evidence of my dedication to creating educational
              games and shows how interactive simulations can help students of
              all skill levels understand and enjoy difficult subjects.
